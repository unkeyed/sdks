// UnprocessableEntityErrorResponse - Error response when the request is syntactically valid but cannot be processed due to semantic constraints or resource limitations. This occurs when:
// - A query exceeds execution time limits
// - A query uses more memory than allowed
// - A query scans too many rows
// - A query result exceeds size limits
//
// The request syntax is correct, but the operation cannot be completed due to business rules or resource constraints. Review the error details for specific limitations and adjust your request accordingly.
