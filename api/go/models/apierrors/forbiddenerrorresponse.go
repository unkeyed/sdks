// - The root key doesn't have the required permissions for this endpoint
// - The operation requires elevated privileges that the current key lacks
// - Access to the requested resource is restricted based on workspace settings
//
// To resolve this error, ensure your root key has the necessary permissions or contact your workspace administrator.
