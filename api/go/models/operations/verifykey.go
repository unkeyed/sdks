	// Key verification process completed. This endpoint always returns HTTP 200 regardless of whether the key passed or failed verification. You must check the `valid` field in the response data to determine the actual verification result.
	//
	// When verification succeeds, the response includes comprehensive information about the key including its current status, remaining credits, expiration time, associated permissions and roles, metadata, and any rate limiting information. This data enables your application to make informed authorization decisions and provide appropriate user experiences.
	//
	// When verification fails, the response indicates the specific reason through the `code` field while setting `valid` to false. The failure codes help you handle different scenarios appropriately, such as directing users to renew expired keys, upgrade for more credits, or contact support for disabled keys.
	//
	// The response also includes identity information when the key is associated with an identity, providing additional context about the key holder and any identity-specific rate limits or metadata that may apply to the verification.
