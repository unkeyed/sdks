type V2KeysAddPermissionsResponseBody struct {
	// Metadata object included in every API response. This provides context about the request and is essential for debugging, audit trails, and support inquiries. The `requestId` is particularly important when troubleshooting issues with the Unkey support team.
	Meta Meta `json:"meta"`
	// Complete list of all permissions directly assigned to the key (including both newly added permissions and those that were already assigned).
	//
	// This response includes:
	// - All direct permissions assigned to the key (both pre-existing and newly added)
	// - Both the permission ID and name for each permission
	//
	// Important notes:
	// - This list does NOT include permissions granted through roles
	// - For a complete permission picture, use `/v2/keys.getKey` instead
	// - An empty array indicates the key has no direct permissions assigned
