type V2KeysAddRolesResponseBody struct {
	// Metadata object included in every API response. This provides context about the request and is essential for debugging, audit trails, and support inquiries. The `requestId` is particularly important when troubleshooting issues with the Unkey support team.
	Meta Meta `json:"meta"`
	// Complete list of all roles directly assigned to the key after the operation completes.
	//
	// The response includes:
	// - All roles now assigned to the key (both pre-existing and newly added)
	// - Both ID and name of each role for easy reference
	// - Roles sorted alphabetically by name for consistent response format
	//
	// Important notes:
	// - The response shows the complete current state after the addition
	// - An empty array means the key has no roles assigned (unlikely after an add operation)
	// - This only shows direct role assignments, not inherited or nested roles
	// - Role permissions are not expanded in this response - use keys.getKey for full details
	Data []Role `json:"data"`
